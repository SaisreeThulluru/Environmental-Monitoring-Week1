# 🌍 Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control - Week 1
Week 1 milestone project for AICTE Edunet Internship – Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control using sample air quality data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on monitoring environmental pollution levels using sample air quality data.  
It analyzes pollutant levels such as PM2.5, NO₂, and CO to understand air quality trends and patterns.  

Prepared as part of the **AICTE Edunet Internship (Green Skills - AI)**, Week 1 Milestone.


## 📊 Week 1 Milestone
- Set up GitHub repository for the project.  
- Collected and used a sample dataset of pollution levels.  
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Visualized pollutant trends over time.  


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
